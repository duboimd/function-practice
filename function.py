# QUESTION 4. In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
# chickens = 2 legs
# cows = 4 legs
# pigs = 4 legs
# The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that prints the total number of legs of all the animals.

# animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36
# animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22
# animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50

print("Question 5:")
# QUESTION 5. Create a function that takes two arguments. Both arguments are integers, a and b. Print true if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10.
# Examples:
# makesTen(9, 10) ➞ true
# makesTen(9, 9) ➞ false
# makesTen(1, 9) ➞ true

print()
print("Question 6:")
# QUESTION 6. Create a function that takes a number as an argument and prints negative of that number. Print negative numbers without any change.

print()
print("Question 7:")
# QUESTION 7. Create a function that prints True if a string is empty and False otherwise.
#Examples:

#acceptIntoMovie(14, true) ➞ true
#acceptIntoMovie(14, false) ➞ false
#acceptIntoMovie(16, false) ➞ true

print()
print("Question 9:")
# QUESTION 9. Given a string, print true if its length is even or false if the length is odd.
# Examples:
# oddOrEven("apples") ➞ true
# The word "apples" has 6 characters.
# 6 is an even number, so the program outputs true.
# oddOrEven("pears") ➞ false
# "pears" has 5 letters, and 5 is odd.
# Therefore the program outputs false.
# oddOrEven("cherry") ➞ true

print()
print("Question 10:")
